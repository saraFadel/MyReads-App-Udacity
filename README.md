# MyReads Project

* This is the my submission for Udacity's MyRead App.
* The app consists of 2 page; the first one shows 3 shelfs that contains books according to the status of reading.
* The 2nd page is for searching for books.
* I used Udacity APIs for retrieving the books also the backend was provided from Udacity as a starter code. 

 
## Technolgies in this app:

* Node js 
* React 


## To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`



## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md].
That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
